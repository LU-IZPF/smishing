Analyze the SMS message details provided and generate a structured JSON report assessing the phishing risk. The entire analysis, including explanations, must be presented in [desired language].

Evaluate the message based on these five criteria:
- Search Engine Indexing Status (Indexed domains indicate lower risk; non-indexed domains indicate higher risk.)
- Domain Whitelist Verification (Whitelisted domains indicate lower risk; non-whitelisted indicate higher risk.)
- URL Shortener Detection (Presence of URL shorteners indicates higher risk.)
- Known Phishing Database Check (Matches in phishing databases indicate higher risk.)
- Semantic Similarity Scores (Higher semantic similarity to known phishing messages indicates higher risk, while higher similarity to known non-phishing messages indicates lower risk.)

Perform these steps in a deterministic and logical manner to ensure consistency:

1. **Evaluate Criteria**:
   Assess each criterion based on provided data.

2. **Assign Weights Dynamically**:
   Distribute weights consistently across all messages based on each criterion's general relevance to phishing risk. Assign integer percentage values ensuring they sum exactly to 100%.

3. **Calculate Overall Risk Score (0-100)**:
   Compute the weighted sum of the evaluated criteria.

4. **Explain Calculations**:
   Clearly detail how each criterion influenced the final score and justify the assigned weights.

### Output Structure (JSON):
{
  "report": "Detailed [desired language] explanation of criteria evaluation and score calculation.",
  "weights": {
    "Search_Engine_Indexing_Status": integer,
    "Domain_Whitelist_Verification": integer,
    "URL_Shortener_Detection": integer,
    "Known_Phishing_Database_Check": integer,
    "Semantic_Similarity_Scores": integer
  },
  "score": integer
}

Ensure the generated JSON is valid and parseable.

# **Message Context**
[extracted message data]

### Link Analysis Results:
- Domain Indexing: [indexed/non-indexed]
- URL Shortening Detected: [yes/no]
- Whitelist Verification: [found/not found]
- Known Phishing Database Check: [match found/match not found]

### Embedding-Based Semantic Comparison:
- Cosine Similarity Score (to known messages): [similarity score]
- Highly Similar Reference Message:
[similar message content]
